## How to use this repo

The course will walk you step by step on what to do. This codebase is the starting point of your journey!

In order to install and run the project locally, run:

Right now, the project is a GraphQL server returning playlist and track data at `http://localhost:4000`. You can use visit `http://localhost:4000` directly, or use [Apollo Sandbox](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox?endpoint=http://localhost:5059/graphql) to connect to the endpoint and send queries.

Try running this query:

```graphql
query GetFeaturedPlaylists {
  featuredPlaylists {
    id
    name
    description
    tracks {
      id
      name
      explicit
      uri
    }
  }
}
```

The `final` branch of this repo contains the final stage of the course, with all of the steps and code completed! If you get stuck, you can refer to it and compare your code.
